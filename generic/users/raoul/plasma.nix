Das Problem kann aber umgangen werden: Dazu muss Strg+W auf Strg+F4 umgelegt werden, wenn Qt-Designer das aktive Fenster ist. Immer wenn Sie dann in Qt-Designer Strg+W drücken, wird in Wirklichkeit Strg+F4 an das Programm gemeldet. In anderen Programmen wird Strg+W natürlich wie gewohnt weiter funktionieren.\n\nEs müssen drei Dinge eingestellt werden: Eine neue Tastenkombination für „Strg+W“, eine neue Tastaturaktion, die Strg+F4 sendet, und eine neue Bedingung für das aktive Qt-Designer-Fenster.\nDer Fenstertitel von Qt-Designer scheint grundsätzlich „Qt Designer by Trolltech“ zu lauten, also wird die Bedingung auf diesen Fenstertitel prüfen.";
